Mercury Orchestra

Second violinist, Summer 2015.
<br><br>
The Mercury Orchestra's mission is to bring great works of the symphony orchestra repertoire to Cambridge, Massachusetts, in live performances of the highest quality, to bring amateur orchestral musicians together in the Cambridge area to play challenging repertoire, and to educate new audiences about the rich traditions of classical music. The summer 2015 season included Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra, three works by Miklos Rozsa, the overture from Mozart's "The Magic Flute", Brahms' Symphony 3, and Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 2 in B-Flat Major.
