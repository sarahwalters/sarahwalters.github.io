Olin Conductorless Orchestra
***
Olin College, Fall 2013 - present.
<br><br>
The Olin Conductorless Orchestra (OCO) is student-led -- we choose our own pieces, direct our own rehearsals, and perform as a chamber ensemble. Among other pieces, we've played Bernstein's Symphonic Dances from West Side Story, Copland's Appalachian Spring, parts of Dvorak's 8th Symphony, excerpts from Saint-Saens' Carnival of the Animals, Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries, and (to the delight of our audience) the theme from "Game of Thrones".
