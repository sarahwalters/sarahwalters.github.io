User-Oriented Collaborative Design (UOCD), Olin College, Spring 2015.
***
UOCD teaches user-oriented, collaborative approaches to design, seeking holistic solutions integrating user and functional perspectives. Among other topics, it covers design thinking, user research, concept development and interaction design including usability engineering. Each team of 5 students chooses a group of people, observes and engages with them to develop a deep understanding of their values and the patterns of their lives, then produces a specification for and a prototype of a product which would benefit the group.

My team worked with street musicians in the Boston area. We learned that they feel like they are treated as beggars even though they are providing a service, that they're often looking to connect with their audiences even though the audiences disappear each time a train departs, and that many of them hope to use street performing as a springboard into a music career. Ultimately, we developed a product concept for an app which enables street musicians to communicate their preferred form of appreciation to their audiences.
