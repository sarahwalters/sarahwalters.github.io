Violinist, Spring 2014 - present.

Some friends and I started a string quartet in the spring of 2014. Since then, we've performed movements from Dvorak's String Quartet No.12, Op.96 ("American"), Brahms' Quartet Op. 51 No. 2, Schubert’s Quartet No. 14 in D minor ("Death and the Maiden"), and Beethoven’s Quartet Op. 18 No. 1 in F Major. Last spring, we performed our first full work -- Shostakovich's Quartet no. 8.
