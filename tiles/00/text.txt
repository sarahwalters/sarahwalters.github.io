PianoBot uses 36 servo-actuated fingers to play a keyboard from PDF sheet music or from a MIDI sound file. The project was an eight-week undertaking for the Olin College Principles of Engineering (PoE) class in Fall 2014. PoE seeks to teach students to integrate analysis, qualitative design, quantitative optimization, experiments, and simulations through a significant project experience designing and building a mechatronic system with nontrivial electrical, mechanical, and software components.

I wrote the Python software which sends data over serial port to PianoBot's Arduino as well as the Arduino software which sends commands to the array of servos. Along the way, I encountered first Arduino's SRAM limit and then significant serial communication delay, both of which limited PianoBot's playing speed. I was able to make use of Arduino's EEPROM to resolve the issue, and the most current version of the Arduino software can send servo commands faster than the servos can respond.
